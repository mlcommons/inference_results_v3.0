# XE8545 System Architecture

The [Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545](https://www.delltechnologies.com/resources/en-gb/asset/data-sheets/products/servers/dell-emc-poweredge-xe8545-spec-sheet.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data direct from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage, or camera) directly to GPU device memory. The XE8545 is a switchless, PCIe-Gen4 server with two 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processors. The tested config has a 2-to-1 ratio of NVIDIA A100 SXM4 GPUs to Mellanox CX6 NICs.

We enabled GPUDirect based on Dell's internal bandwidth measurements. The highest bandwidth requirement per GPU for the submitted benchmarks is 6.38GB/s on XE8545; the system is able to meet this requirement.   

We also enabled the end_on_device flag for 3D-Unet based on those same internal bandwidth measurements.
